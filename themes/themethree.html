                <h2>Assignment: 04.01.01 Sprite animation on a background</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themethree-text">
                    <p>Goal: For this assignment, we had to develop a character based on our research and moodboard. Afterwards, to create a corresponding character’s visual design and background, and then employ animation principles to create walk cycles.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: All elements such as sketching, illustrations and coding were done by me. </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: The assignment helped learn how to reflect the character’s identity visually, create an illustration based on sketching and how to use CSS so that the background is adjusted to the screen and character moving throughout it.</p>
                    </div>

                <h2>Assignment: 04.02.01 Javascript controlled animation</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themethree-text-1">
                    <p>Goal: To use SVG animation and with the help of CSS create 10 different animation functions that they can be switched on and off with javascript.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: As it was an individual work, everything was done by myself.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: I’ve acquired additional knowledge about CSS animation, and its variations such as spinning, skewing and the like. Besides this, I learnt the basics of javascript, especially when it comes to the button control so it enacts the desired animation.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Assignment: 04.03.01 Project pool 1 </h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themethree-text-2">
                    <p>Goal: To create a page where based on the user’s submitted answers the fortune teller randomly selects one of the predefined answers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: Within a group, my focus area was to create content and assisting with coding.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: The task introduced me to new ways of using javascript such as Math.random() and it was great exercise how to solve a coding-based issue as a team.</p>

                    <br>
