                <h2>Assignment: 03.01.01 - Data collection</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themetwo-text-1">
                    <p>Goal: To learn how to apply different ways of examination, including both primary and secondary methods, as well as their applicability in real case scenarios. The assignment consisted of three parts: desk research, observation research and conducting interviews and surveys.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: From online research to extracting findings based on the conducted interview, everything was carried out individually.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: Both research and documentation parts were appealing to the geek at heart. With that said, conducting qualitative primary research such as interview was an area that required practice, so observing people and discovering patterns; creating an interview framework based on a goal, relevant questions and flows, as well as analyzing findings to get more details insights from a potential user. On top of that, for future projects, I’ve learnt that not only the quality of the content matters but also the ease and presentation of the information. </p>

                <h2>Assignment: 03.03.01 - Prototype</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themetwo-text-2">
                    <p>Goal: To create an interactive, high-fidelity <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/spec/5cc80550-cec7-4619-483c-0849ea0b8f2d-2af9/screen/5a4c3640-e187-49ae-b3ca-0407ada36b86/Web-1920-11/">website prototype</a>, aiming to help international students in Copenhagen to find housing, jobs or extend their social networks. Our XD prototype included all three, but the flow had a particular focus on connecting students through activity-based events that they can attend and meet like-minded people. The prototype was also in-line with the brand of the Ministry of Higher Education and Science.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: This was a pair project. From the design convention research and development of the idea to design guidelines, all our high-level decisions were taken mutually. Then each of us took charge in terms of research and documentation, as well as design. I took lead on providing the foundation for our design decisions, conduction of the research and its documentation. </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">

                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: Understanding the importance of design conventions and how they relate to the user’s past experiences and thus, create credibility and intuitive decision-making. Also, creating a prototype within the brand guidelines and reiterating the concept of it based on our testing results.</p>

                <h2>Assignment: 03.04.01 - Design sprint</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themetwo-text-3">
                    <p>Goal: Inspired by Google Sprint methodology, the task was to replicate the process of design sprint and create and a native app to better the life of KEA’s students. The project involved setting a long-term goal and reverse-engineering the process, which included brainstorming sketching, copywriting, prototyping and more.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: Within this group assignment, I primarily took part in the concept development, written content and documentation, as well as pitch preparation and presentation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">

                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: This assignment provided the main learnings within the group environment: how to transition from brainstorming to taking hands-on action, combining several ideas instead of choosing just one and having a no-frills and MVP approach rather than perfecting the prototype. Also, learning about the sprint methodology and its appliance. </p>
