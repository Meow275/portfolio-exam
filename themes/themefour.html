                <h2>Assignment: 05.02.01 “Foodsharing Copenhagen”. A campaign site including a video.</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themefour-text">
                    <p>Goal: To design an interactive <a href="http://colorless.in/foodsharing/">landing page</a> for a campaign called #LittleHeartbreaks, raising awareness about one of the messages by FoodSharing Copenhagen—the food that is thrown away at home substantially contributes to the wastage issue. Through interactive content such as video and captivating imagery and copywriting, our aim was to invoke emotions by portraying food that we buy more than just grocery items, but as relationships and commitments instead.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: As it was a group effort, and the video and site were the end products. Up until the creation of both of them, I took part in the concept and storyboard development and shooting the video, as well as creating the campaign content and customer pitch both slides and the presentation of it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: With this campaign, I learnt how to arrange and shoot a video, create a written copy for the campaign and organize it with other visual elements, as well as extract and prepare key information so that is interesting and visually appealing for a potential customer. </p>

                <h2>Assignment:  05.02.03 “Storyboard”. A pdf document with your drawn storyboard.</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themefour-text-1">
                    <p>Goal: To create a storyboard for a campaign video shoot. The documentation served as a reference point during the actual filming and had to have visual and textual components so that everything can be done smoothly. This meant planning scenes and sequences in advance; shot types and angles; making decisions in regards to actors, locations, audio and the like.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: Being part of a group, I helped plan the composition of scenes, and helped edit and finalise the visual and textual part of the storyboard.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: Learning about different types of editing and shooting nuances such as composition, angles and types what purpose each one can serve from the viewer’s perspective.</p>

                <h2>Assignment: 05.02.04 “Customer pitch”</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="themefour-text-2">
                    <p>Goal: Put together a clear, compelling and visually-appealing presentation representing our created campaign for FoodSharing Copenhagen.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My part: Within our group, my role was to style the slides, prepare the content and present it. </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="portrait">
                        <img src="../images/about.jpg" alt="Me" width="850" height="600">
                        <br>
                        <p>Key takeaways: I’ve learnt how to prepare for a pitch and present the highlights of our campaign, as well as receive client feedback. On top of that, the importance of having a holistic approach throughout the preparation for your pitch, and not just focusing on focusing too much on one aspect.</p>
